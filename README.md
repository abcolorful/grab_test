Given a sorted array of integers and a variable n, please write an algorithm to find out all pairs in the array that sum value equal to n.
For example,
given [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 9] and n=10,
you should output [1,9], [1,9], [2,8], [3,7]
Please
1. write the code and related unit tests.
2. implement the code with less time consuming method
